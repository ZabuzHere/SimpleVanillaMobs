## About
This is a very generic plugin that will add Mobs to your PM5 worlds.
<br />
* This is really barebones right now
* Mobs have no real behavior yet other than moving around
* Zombies and other hostile mobs will attack you depending on game mode
* A few hostile mobs will attack each other
* Not many config options yet but there are a few
* You can do /killmobs to wipe out all mobs
* You can do /listmobs to list all spawned mobs
* You can do /summon Mob [quantity] to summon mobs to your location
